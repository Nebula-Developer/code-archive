# Compassion
### An amazing library designed for C#. 

Compassion is a simple, yet useful library containing functions like: <br><br>

- `Hold(int: Milliseconds); - Wait for a certain amount of milliseconds before continuing. This is a function, and will not return anything.`

- `BoolToInt(bool: BoolToConvert); - Convert true to 1, false to 0, and null to -1 in a bool. This will return an int.`

- `StringToInt(string: StringToConvert); - Convert a string to an integer. Simple as that. This will return an int.`

- `RandomStringFromArray(string[]: ArrayToRandomise); - Get a random string from the given array. This will return a string.`

- `RandomChance(int: Chance); - Give the result 'true' if the randomisation from the chance was successful. This will return a bool.`

- `PromptBorder(string: BorderChars, int: BorderLength, string: Prompt, int: Spacing, bool: EvenBorder); - Supply a prompt surrounded by a `
`custom border. This will return a string.`

- `YesNoChoice(string: Prompt); - Present a y/n option, pre-expressed with a prompt. This will return a bool.`
`Hello`
