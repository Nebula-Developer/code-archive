                    <p>Sharks are sea animals that have been around for more than 400 million years. There are over 500
                        different species of sharks, and ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark, which is only 6
                        inches long, to the whale shark, which can be up to 50 feet long. Most sharks are predators,
                        meaning they hunt and eat fish, seals, and other sea animals. Some sharks eat plankton, the
                        smallest creatures in the ocean, and are called filter feeders.</p>

                    <p>Sharks are often thought of as dangerous killers that attack humans, but this is usually not the
                        case. Most sharks are not interested in attacking humans, and will only do so if they are
                        confused or curious. Sometimes, a shark may mistake a human for a seal, or may be curious about
                        what that human is. But, <b>this is not to say that sharks are not dangerous!</b> Some species
                        of sharks are more aggressive than others, and some are more likely to attack humans. This
                        includes the <b>great white shark</b>, <b>the tiger shark</b>, and the <b>bull shark</b>.
                        However, these sharks are not the mindless killers that they are often made out to be. Let's
                        take a closer look at some of the dangerous species of sharks, and why we should be cautious
                        around them.
