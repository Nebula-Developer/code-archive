<!-- HTML is a very basic markup language. -->
<!-- It is essentially the layout and structure of a web page. -->

<!-- Paragraphs are represented as the following: -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Headings are represented as the following: -->
<h1>This is a heading.</h1>
<!-- Heading sizes range from 1-6, I recommend sticking with 1 and restyling it with css. -->
<h6>This is a small heading.</h6>

<!-- Links are represented as the following (and can be put in other text): -->
<a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link.</a>

<!-- Images: -->
<img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png" alt="Google Logo">

<!--
B = Bold
I = Italic
U = Underline
S = Strikethrough
-->
<b>Bold</b>
<i>Italic</i>
<u>Underline</u>
<s>Strikethrough</s>

<!-- To link a css file, use the following: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[path to css file]">
<!-- To link a javascript file, use the following: -->
<script src="[path to javascript file]"></script>

<!-- To add a class or ID to an element, use the following: -->
<p class="my-class">This is a paragraph with a class.</p>
<p id="my-id">This is a paragraph with an ID.</p>

<!-- Now, we can style everything with css: -->
<style>
    .my-class {
        color: red;
    }

    #my-id {
        color: blue;
    }

    /*
        # = id
        . = class
        p, h1, a, etc.. = tag
    */

    img {
        width: 100px;
        height: auto;
    }

    /* We can assign display types: */
    body {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        /* Now everything will be on a new line. */
    }
</style>

<!-- To write javascript in the html file, use the script tag: -->
<script>
    console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>

<!--
    There is many other things you can do with html,
    but those are basically all you need to know.
-->
