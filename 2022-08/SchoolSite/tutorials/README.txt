I supplied three tutorials on javascript, html, and css.

I wrote them pretty quickly, so they miss a bit of information, 
but they are by far enough to get you started.

Information on the languages:
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, the language that makes up the structure of the web.
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets, the language that makes up the style of the web. (Colors, background, fonts, position, etc...)
JavaScript - The language that makes up the behavior of the web. (Click events, server communication, variables, etc...)

I hope they help!
