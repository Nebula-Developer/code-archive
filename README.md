# NebulaDev Stack
### Stuff that I use, that you might too.

This is a collection of very opinionated templates for my web stacks.

I've gone through a lot of different stacks, and over time I've found that I like to use the same tools over and over again. The 'big three' that seem to be consistent are [Astro](https://astro.build/), [SolidStart](https://https://start.solidjs.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Feel free to use these templates as a starting point for your own projects. They might not be the best for you, but I love them.
